# Example of mocking plain java delegates with camunda

This project is based on the generation by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-servlet-war-7.5.0](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## Show me the important parts!
This example shows how to implement tests with plain java delegates like you would do with expression based delegates like CDI-Beans.

## How does it work?

                                 
## How to use it?
Just as you would test processes with CDI based Java Delegates you can do that now with plain old java delegates as well.
Please check `MockingTest` for usage.

## Environment Restrictions
